ParkWise: A data-driven web application that analyzes historical parking violation patterns to help users
find the safest places to park and avoid costly tickets.

Parking violations cost drivers billions annually, with Chicago alone issuing over 28 million tickets.
Current parking apps only show availability, not enforcement risk. ParkWise fills this gap by analyzing
historical violation data to predict where and when you're most likely to get ticketed.

Features (Planned)
- Risk Heat Maps: Visual representation of parking violation frequency by location and time
- Smart Predictions: "Safe to park here until 3pm on weekdays" recommendations
- Historical Analytics: Violation patterns across different neighborhoods and times
- Real-time Updates: User-reported enforcement activity
- Mobile Responsive: Optimized for on-the-go parking decisions
